#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the base and height of a triangle and returns its area.
base = float(input("Enter base: "))
height = float(input("Enter height: "))
area_of_triangle = 1/2 * base * height
print("Area of triangel =", area_of_triangle)

# ans:
#     Enter base: 8.5
#     Enter height: 5.64
#     Area of triangel = 23.97
